# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Model by Akshay

This project is a **weather forecasting application** built using **Streamlit**, which predicts the likelihood of rain based on various weather parameters. The model achieves an **accuracy of 99.8%** using the **RandomForestClassifier** algorithm from `scikit-learn`.
